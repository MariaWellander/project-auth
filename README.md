# Project Auth API

This is a pair-programming project by Kartika Purwahyuningrum and Maria Wellander.
	
This project's goal was developing an API with authentication in order to implement a login/register interface with authentication.

## The problem

We learned how to authenticate users using tokens and how to store passwords in databases in a secure way. We also created a Frontend with a form to register, login and be able to see restricted content in case the login was successful.
	
We used MongodB and Mongoose to build our Backend Express API, with libraries such as crypto and bcrypt. We used React, Redux and Styled components to build our frontend.
